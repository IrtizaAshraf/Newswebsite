    <h3>KEY TAKEAWAYS</h3>
    <li>Usually there are no problems when trading on Forex, and there is more than enough liquidity.</li><br>
    <li>The value of a currency is measured by how much another currency can be bought with one unit of it. This is called a price quote.</li><br>
    <li>The purchasing power of the average trader is usually very small compared to higher level traders that they need a Forex broker or bank to provide a trading account, financial leverage and access to the market via trading servers.</li><br>
    <h2 id="what-is-forex-trading">What is Forex Trading</h2> <br><br>
    <p>Forex trading essence can be explained like this - the value of a currency is measured by how much another currency can be bought with one unit of it. This is called a price quote. A quote always consists of two prices - bid (bid or ask price) and ask (ask or offer price). You buy currency at the ask price, and when you sell it, at the ask price. <br><br>
        Later in your educational curve you can learn What is <span> Cryptocurrency</span> as well. But if you are interested, we welcome you to jump start now. <br><br>
        I want to note that the offer price of any financial instrument is always higher than the ask price. <br><br>

        The bank will always buy your currency a little cheaper and sell it to you at a higher rate. The spread is the difference between the bid and ask price, which is the commission you pay to a broker for providing services. <br><br>
        
        Bid and ask prices are available to market participants at any time, except when the market is closed. The trader receives quotes via the Internet from the broker who provided him with a trading account. In turn, the brokerage firm receives price quotes from its liquidity providers, i.e. banks. <br><br>
        
        Generally speaking, the more liquid the market, the smaller the spread. Usually there are no problems when trading on Forex, and there is more than enough liquidity. However, there are times, for example during the release of important news, when there are gaps (price gaps) due to strong price changes over very short periods of time. <br><br>
        
        The rest is simple mechanics.</p> <br><br> 
        <h2 id="how-does-forex-trading-work">How does Forex Trading Work</h2> <br><br>
        <p>So, how does the foreign exchange market work is a question that every beginner should know the answer to.</p> <br><br>
        <p>Trading in the foreign exchange market takes place by clicking on the trading platform that the trader choosed. When an order is placed to buy the EUR/USD currency pair, part of the funds from the trader's account is used to buy the base currency of the EUR/USD pair, in this case, the euro, and sell the quote currency (US dollars).</p> <br><br>

       <center> <img src="what-is-forex-1.png" alt="" width="1000"></center>
       <p>The order is placed either with a broker or directly displayed on the interbank Forex market, where there are large players.</p> <br><br>
       <p>Depending on the trading strategy, the trader waits for the owned currency to rise in price and sell it. When the trader is satisfied with the profit, he closes the order, and the broker does the opposite, meaning - sells euros and buys dollars. When a trader places a sell order, the opposite process occurs.</p> <br><br>

       <p>So, what is the Forex market and what is the function of the foreign exchange market? Let's dive in.

        Forex (foreign exchange market) is an international over-the-counter foreign exchange market in which market participants trade by buying and selling currency pairs.</p> <br><br>
        <p> <i>Let's talk a little about the Forex market participants:</i></p> <br><br>
        <p>The Forex market is mainly dominated by large national banks, multinational companies, and hedge funds whose trading decisions significantly impact currency prices. On the other hand, medium-sized companies, private investors, and those who require hedging services rely on private banks. Financial brokers, smaller banks, and investors are among the smaller market participants.</p> <br><br>

            Most of the significant market participants have direct access to the interbank Forex market, where currency exchange transactions occur without intermediaries. This privilege is granted to those with a considerable amount of funds that exceed a specific threshold.</p> <br><br>

            <h2 id="how-to-trade-forex">How to Trade Forex</h2> <br><br>
            <p>Now that you know basic concepts let’s move on to the next steps.</p> <br><br>
            <h3 id="step1">1. Select a currency pair</h3>
            <p>When trading forex you will always buy one currency while selling another at the same time. Because of this, you will always trade currencies in a pair. Most new traders will start out by trading the most commonly offered pairs of major currencies, but you can trade any currency pair that is available on the trading platform as long as you have enough money in your account.</p> <br> <br>
            <h3 id="step2">2. Analyze the market</h3>
            <p>Research and analysis is the foundation of trading endeavors. During researching, you’ll find great amount of forex resources, which is overwhelming at first. But as you research a particular currency pair, you’ll find valuable resources that stand out from the rest.</p> <br><br>
            <h3 id="step3">3. Read the quote</h3>
            <p>You’ll see two prices shown for currency pairs (picture showing base and quote currency). The first rate is the price at which you can sell the currency pair and the second rate is the price at which you can buy the currency pair. Difference between the two rates is called the spread. You can view our live spreads</p><br><br>
            <h3 id="step4">4. Pick your position</h3>
            <p>In Forex trading you can speculate the currency on up and down movements in the market.

                With a buy position you believe that the value of the base currency will rise compared to the quote currency. For example if you are buying EUR/USD, you believe the price of the euro will strengthen against the dollar.
                With a sell position you believe that the value of the base currency will fall compared to the quote currency. For example if you’re selling EUR/USD, you believe the price of the euro will weaken against the dollar.
